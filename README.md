# bevy_gearbox

Statecharts for Bevy, designed for ECS-first workflows and data-driven tools. Pairs well with the visual editor [`bevy_gearbox_editor`](https://github.com/DEMIURGE-studio/bevy_gearbox_editor).

## Overview

bevy_gearbox provides a state machine runtime modeled after XState’s core ideas (LCA-based transitions, entry/exit/transition phases, eventless transitions), adapted to Bevy’s ECS. It’s not a perfect logical match to XState; it prioritizes Bevy ergonomics, serialization, and editor integration.

## Why use bevy_gearbox

- ECS-first design: states, transitions, and hierarchy are plain components and entities.
- Deterministic state changes: exit → transition actions → entry; LCA-based pathing.
- Data-driven: author machines in scenes; integrate with tools out of the box.
- Editor ecosystem: pairs with [`bevy_gearbox_editor`](https://github.com/DEMIURGE-studio/bevy_gearbox_editor) for rapid iteration and live statechart inspection.

## Core concepts

- Logical hierarchy (independent of scene graph): `StateChildOf` / `StateChildren`.
- Activation semantics:
  - Root remains active for the machine lifetime.
  - Entering a state enters all ancestors down to the leaf.
  - Self-transitions are external by default; use `EdgeKind::Internal` to suppress re-entry.
- Transition entities:
  - `Source(Entity)`, `Target(Entity)`, `EdgeKind`.
  - Event-driven transitions via `EventEdge<E>` components on edges.
  - Eventless transitions: `AlwaysEdge`.
  - Delayed transitions: `After { duration }` with cancellation on exit.
- Guards:
  - ECS-managed guard failure sets with per-edge checks.
  - Composition support planned via a small `Logic` tree.
- Actions envelope:
  - `TransitionActions` emitted between exits and entries.
  - Author “assign/raise/send/cancel” patterns as normal systems.

## Quick start

1) Add the plugin and your event observers

```rust
app.add_plugins(GearboxPlugin)
   .add_observer(edge_event_listener::<YourEvent>);
```

2) Send events to the machine root; the listener routes to active leaves internally

```rust
commands.trigger_targets(YourEvent, machine_root);
```

3) Author via code or scenes

- Spawn states and edges with `Source`, `Target`, `EdgeKind`, `EventEdge<E>`, `AlwaysEdge`, `After`.
- Or load a scene authored with [`bevy_gearbox_editor`](https://github.com/DEMIURGE-studio/bevy_gearbox_editor).

# !!! FOOTGUN ALERT !!!

When manually building state machines through commands it is important to add the StateMachine component to your root last. This initializes the machine, and if you don't add the StateMachine to the root after you've added all your InitialState components to other state entities, it will not initialize correctly. The proper "layout" for building statechart entities is demonstrated in the repeater example. This is not a problem if you use a scene to spawn your statechart. You can author statechart scenes using the [editor](https://github.com/DEMIURGE-studio/bevy_gearbox_editor). In the future this will be solved by building state machines through bsn.
