/// ability_entity will transition to IdleState. At this point, the parent transitions

/// Sub state machines usually exist to change the state of their top-most parent SM entity. 
/// In other words, the bottom-most active state machine dictates the behavior of the top most entity.

/// sub-SMs. You can make arbitrarily deep heirarchies, and the bottom level will dictate the 
/// behavior of the top.
